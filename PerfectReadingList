So I combed through Cirnosad's tweets and found all the books, articles, and videos I could find and put them into a list.

I combed his tweets for the keywords: "read", "reading", "homework", "check", "book", "article", ".com", ".org", ".edu", ".gov", ".co.uk", "YouTube", "manga", "anime", "filter:video", ".co.jp", and "movie".

I am certainly missing many references and sources as the searches are not perfect, in particular the ".com" search is glitchy and surely missed a lot. I got the music from "filter:video" and "YouTube".

Is this overkill? Most certainly. Am I a bit obsessive? Yeah, whatever.

I love Cirno-sensei and we could all do well to learn from him. There's something here for everyone.

This list doesn't include his product recommendations or his beautiful living soul.

Love, Dawnlander <3
